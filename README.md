# Overhead-tank-water-quality-management-system
An Solution to Mastek's DEEPBLUE S8 2023 problem statement

In this project, I developed an advanced water quality monitoring system specifically designed for overhead tanks. The goal was to create a reliable and efficient way to ensure the water in these tanks meets the highest quality standards.

To achieve this, I designed a system that continuously monitors various parameters of the water, including temperature, pH levels, turbidity, and contamination. The system utilizes a combination of sensors and data processing technologies to provide real-time insights into the water quality.

One of the key features of the system is its ability to send alerts if any of the monitored parameters fall outside of the acceptable range. This ensures that any potential issues can be addressed promptly, helping to maintain the safety and cleanliness of the water supply.

Overall, this project not only enhances the monitoring capabilities for overhead tanks but also contributes to better water management and safety.
